Research Question:
Can we make the game easier for the player to survive in for the total amount of time per run?
Can using a powerup that is spawned at different time rates allow for the game to be easier, harder or have no affect on the difficulty at all.

Variables:
- Independent Variables
	Powerup spawning time ( (A [HARD] - 15 seconds, B [EASY] - 10 seconds) )
	Powerup effect time ( Dependent on how many enemies have already been spawned on the current screen )

- Dependent Variables
	The total survival time ( measured in intergers )

Hypothesis:
Allowing for the player to collect the powerup, this will always ensure to increase the player's survival time, regardless of skill level, experience, RNG.

" If we change powerup spawn timer, then 'Survival Time' increases , because current enemies on screen movement's speed is decreased. "

Analysis:
- Condition A
	Average = 16.78 , Median = 31.3
	
- Condition B 
	Average = 21.3 , Median = 21.5


Does the data support the hypothesis?
- Yes each player despite their skill level, experience, etc had longer survival times per run.

Were there large differences or only small ones?
- There were outliers due to the Conditions for how fast or slow the powerup was spawned in by. If a weaker player could get the powerup with Condition B ( EASY ), then they survived longer. 
  However this did not help more skilled players, instead when Condition A ( HARD ) was active, the skilled players lasted longer due to be able to survive longer and choose when to use the powerup after 15 seconds.
  
Design Decision:
- Ideally we feel that an inbetween value between the two Conditions ( ( A = 15, B = 10 ) -> 12 ), means it would be the most suitable for both weaker and skilled players.
  However Condition A would fit our experiment since our goal was to help weaker skilled players to help them play the game, but NOT at the expense of breaking the game or reducing difficult gameplay for skilled players.
  We chose Condition A because the data showed it helped weaker players and maintained gameplay difficulty integrity for skilled players.
